			<h1>About</h1>
			<p class="blurb">I'm a 23 year old student who is currently studying a full stack web development course at Coder Academy Bootcamp.</p>
			<h2>Web Development?</h2>
			<p>Yes! Web Development. I was exposed to the world of programming through the process of installing various game mods, and through digging around and trying to troubleshoot my family's tech problems! I've been interested in computing from a young age. </p>
			<p>Out of high school, I started doing a couple python tutorials and started computer science and finance double degree. But due to a combination of little real programming exposure in the course, and my own trouble transitioning my study habits to university, I decided to move to Melbourne and change to a Chemical Engineering degree.</p>
			<p>And I did really well in that degree! But I ultimately found that the field wasn't really going to be for me. So here I am, full circle again. Web development appeals to me because it allows me to tap in to my love of problem solving and express creativity through design. It also is a field that I can continuously learn and improve on, which is what I'm all about. </p>
			<p>This time I come prepared, with study skills I've learned over and engineering degree, and all the right motivations. So web development, here I come!</p>
			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>I'm based in Melbourne, but I grew up across South Australia and Western Australia. Some of my interests are getting out into nature, gaming, cooking, reading, climbing and keeping fit. </p>
