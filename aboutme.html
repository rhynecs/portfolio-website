				<h2>Why Am I Interested In Becoming A Web Developer?</h2>
				<p>Web development appeals to me because it allows me to tap in to my love of problem-solving while allowing me to express some creativity through design. It's a field that I can continuously learn and improve on, which is what I'm all about. </p>
				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>I've lived in Melbourne for the last four years, but I grew up in South Australia and Western Australia. Some of my interests are getting out into nature, gaming, cooking, reading, climbing and keeping fit. </p>
				<h2>How Did I Get Here?</h2>
				<p>I had a glimpse in to the world of code as a kid in the process of installing various game mods, and troubleshooting my family's tech problems. I developed a general interest in tech from a young age, but was never taught how to program. </p>
				<p>After high school I thought this might be a career for me, and I started a finance and computer science double degree for a year, but due to a combination of having little real programming exposure in the course, and my own trouble transitioning my study habits to university, I decided to move to Melbourne and change to a Chemical Engineering degree for a fresh start.</p>
				<p>And I did really well in my new degree, but I ultimately I decided that it wouldn't be the field for me. So here I am, full circle again about to learn to program.</p>
				<p>This time I come prepared with study skills I've learned over the course of an engineering degree, and all the right motivations. So web development, here I come!</p>
